# AudioLibraryModel
The library model follows good software design principles and includes JUnit test. 

The user can perform actions such as saving a song, creating a playlist, etc. The user can also undo/redo these actions. 

Some of the design patterns implemented are the Singleton design pattern, Decorator design pattern, Composite design pattern, and the Command design pattern.
